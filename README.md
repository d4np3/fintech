# Dan's Fintech Bootcamp Repo

My name is Dan. I have worked in the tech space in systems integration for 20 odd years.

I've not done much development other than hack scripts together, so keen to learn more in that space.

I'm interested in finance and technology, as well as bots and AI/ML, hence signing up.
