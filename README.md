### About Me
***

![Me!](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHhlgIWE9G86g/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1516874733999?e=1684368000&v=beta&t=xbhjlBuMLi2r-Tdnq4HKVCvz309_iPirjyGPXOLU-bI)

My name is Dan. I have worked in the tech space in systems integration for 20 odd years.

I've not done much development other than hack scripts together, so keen to learn more.

I'm interested in finance and technology: Bots, AI/ML and blockchain, hence signing up.
